We provide male and female designated sleeping quarters for participants 18 years or older. Minors will not be allowed to stay on premise during the night, but there are a number of inexpensive hotels nearby.

Participants staying on-site should bring their own sleeping supplies and toiletries (sleeping bag, pillow, PJs, Spider Man toothbrush, etc). We do not have shower facilities on site.

We have plenty of snacks and drinks and a midnight meal to keep participants from getting hungry.
