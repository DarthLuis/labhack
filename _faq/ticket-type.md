We've gotten a few questions about what type of ticket a person should get if they have one skillset versus another. The ticket types and descriptions are as follows:

* __developer:__ Developers focus on the technical elements of a product.Back-end developers work on server-side code like PHP and Java frameworks, cloud infrastructure and deployment. Front-end developers focus on the user interface using events, client-side code, web services and some visual elements.

* __designer:__ Designers typically focus on the visual elements and user experience associated with a product. They have a keen eye, usually strong artistic ability and an understanding of psychology and human factors. Their tools of trade usually wireframes, CSS and related technologies (SASS, etc), drawn mockups as well as user interviewing and user story capture.

* __data scientist:__ Data Scientists bridge the gap between computer science, mathematics and business. Activities typically involve gathering and cleaning data, performing analysis and capturing findings using written reports and visualizations.

The event organizers use the ticket types to figure out what types of challenges to offer and determine if there's an under-represented skillset that we need to go out and more actively recruit.

Beyond that, the ticket types don't mean a whole lot. If you're a software developer who dabbles in data science, choosing a developer ticket doesn't prevent you from providing a solution to a data science challenge or vice versa.
