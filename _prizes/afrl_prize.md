#Challenge
Develop an innovative solution to a current Air Force problem using data-driven decision making. Data may include real, publicly-available data or simulated datasets, the source of which should be disclosed in your project.

#Awards

* First Place: $600/team
* Second Place: $300/team
* Third Place: $150/team

#Judging Criteria
The following are subjective guidelines intended for use by the Hackathon judges to guide their selection of winning entries.  Categories are scored on a subjective scale from Poor to Outstanding.  These categories in no way represent an objective weighting and are merely suggestions.  We recommend placing highest emphasis on innovation/creativity in the event of a tie.  However, all categories are equally important otherwise.  We recommend not awarding prizes to entries which score Poor in one or more categories. 

Innovation/Creativity (TB):
(Poor) Unoriginal concept.  Significant or blatant plagiarism from existing software.  

(Average) Project provides a better/faster/clearer way to attack an existing problem.

(Above Average) Project makes something work that an existing software failed to.  Identifies existing software and its shortcomings.

(Excellent) Project tackles a problem that has been overlooked/ignored in the past, or attacks a problem with a new angle / on a bigger scale / on a higher level than existing software.  

(Outstanding) The project attacks an entirely new problem and provides a good solution.  Work presents or portrays clear artistic vision.  

User Experience:
(N/A) Challenge is non-interactive/requires no user input.

(Poor) Does not function properly.  Contains major bugs, errors, or unusable UI.

(Average) Functions properly, but requires extensive knowledge to operate, can be operated by a project team member.

(Above Average) Functions properly.  Not intuitive.  Can be operated by non-team member with clear explicit instructions.

(Excellent) Functions properly.  Intuitive interface.  Could be operated by a college-educated person with no verbal guidance from team members.

(Outstanding) Functions properly.  Easy to use at first glance.  Requires no verbal or written instructions to operate.  Instantly intuitive.  






Impact, Potential and Sustainability:
(Poor) Project is off topic.  Does not address the challenge at hand.

(Average) Project addresses the challenge.  Attempts to tackle a problem related to the function and intent of the challenge sponsor (AFRL).  

(Above Average) Project addresses a problem related to the sponsor’s function.  The team has a clear plan to move forward with potential future impacts of the project.

(Excellent) Project addresses a the root cause of problem related to the sponsor’s function.  Team has a well thought out plan for future endeavours and potential impacts.

(Outstanding) Project addresses a the root cause of problem related to the sponsor’s function.  The team has a clear, well thought out plan addressing the life cycle (from development to fielding to patching and finally replacement/drawdown) and utilizes a well-established open source community supported framework with multi-platform support. 

Resource Usage/Collaboration:
(Poor) The project is isolated, opaque or makes a conscious effort to obscure underlying code.

(Average) The team is willing to collaborate but takes no active measures to facilitate sharing.

(Above Average) The project is open-source, the code is open to share, and the team provided a good API support / documentation for others to pick up.

(Excellent) The project is open-source, the code is open to share, and the team provided an excellent API support / documentation for others to pick up.

(Outstanding) The project is designed in a modular fashion, where each module can be used and repurposed individually.  The project modules are open-source, the code is open to share, and the team provided an excellent API support / documentation for others to pick up.
