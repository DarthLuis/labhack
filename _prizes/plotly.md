Participants in this challenge will stream sensor data from a Rasberry Pi or Arduino Yun to Plotly, then download and analyze that data in an interesting way using another Plotly API (MATLAB, Python, R, Julia, etc). For examples of Plotly sensor and telemetry projects, see Plotly's workshop page: [https://plot.ly/workshop/](https://plot.ly/workshop/ "Plotly Workshop")

Entries will be judged based on compelling use and analysis of sensor data obtained from Hardware.

You can learn more about the Arduino API [here](https://github.com/plotly/arudino-api/ "Plotly Workshop").
You can learn more about Raspberry Pi + Plotly [here](https://github.com/plotly/arudino-api/ "Plotly Workshop").
