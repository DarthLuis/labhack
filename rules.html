<h2>Rules</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Fresh Code We all start coding at the same time. This is done to keep things fair. Please don’t come in and build on top of previous projects if you want to win. It’s cool to wok on designs beforehand, digital mockups, open source frameworks, and anything else available to everyone, but try to keep things within just limits.</li>

    <li>
        Code Review Winning teams will be subject to a code-review at some point following the event or immediately before winning.</li>

    <li>Ownership and IP For the sake of simplicity, all team projects judged in the event will be open sourced with a permissive license.</li>

    <li>
        Team Size Teams of up to 5 humans are allowed. You can also add 1 cyborg, Furby, drone, or Sphero.</li>

    <li>Submissions Projects should be submitted on our hackathon.io page. Submission time is 1pm Sunday.</li>

    <li>DEMO your Hack You must demo your hack in order to present. No slide-decks or power-points will be allowed. Don’t be scared if you didn’t finish… it’s okay long as you tried your best.</li>

    <li>Have fun It’s a hackathon! Use whatever languages or hacks you have in your arsenal. Show us hardware. Show us new concepts. Show us anything you’d like.</li>
